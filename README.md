# Parser Combinators #

Some experimentation with parser combinators.

Traditional deterministic parser combinators were livecoded in Swift (in directory `swift`).
These were implemented in a livecoding session, and the videos are available at these locations:

1. [Part I](https://mycsun.box.com/s/z535lj6f5mnhxq22gg80dyo9fnxx9wke)
2. [Part II](https://mycsun.box.com/s/u6o4f1mxf5wnapbha4el2oqfnguotutl)


## Nondeterministic Parser Combinators ##

An experimental library handling nondeterministic parser combinators is in the `scala` directory.
The readme file in that directory covers more information on those.
